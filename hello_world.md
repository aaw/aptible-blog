YES! Finally! The Aptible team and I are very happy to announce our public launch. For the last few months, we have been working closely with a limited group of digital health companies.

- our customers are the future of healthcare software
-



All of our beta customers are incredibly happy:
- Developers love the workflow and features of the platform
- Ops teams love how quickly and cheaply they've been able to implement an entire HIPAA compliance program
- CEOs love being able to partner with large customers quickly and easily
