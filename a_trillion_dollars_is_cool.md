We've seen a lot of chatter lately about Apple and its impending move into personal health and fitness. Everyone seems to be talking about it, but no one has really explained why it's so radically significant. How valuable could it be, for Apple?

[Analysts are radically undervaluing the potential market in mobile health](http://www.businessinsider.com/apples-health-care-opportunity-2014-2). [Others just don't understand it](http://histalkmobile.com/the-apple-emr/). [John Scully might get it](http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/24/why-health-care-needs-apple/).

In 2011, people joked about Apple being the kind of company that could inspire something along the lines of:

>"A billion dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? A <em>trillion dollars</em>."

That possibility is real right now. The kind of titanic opportunity that shifts an era. Apple has the opportunity to absolutely dominate a small but significant piece of the largest market in America, -- a $2.8 trillion dollar market -- in a very short amount of time, with their combination of devices and consumer-friendly image. And they'd be in a position to expand that segment of the market over the next decade.

How much money could be in play? Hundreds of billions of dollars, maybe more. Imagine an addressable market bigger than pharmaceuticals. By way of comparison, pharma is "just" a $263 billion dollar industry right now. (Globally, [$954B in 2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry#Industry_revenues).) We're talking about unlocking some of the value in the orange box:

(NHE)

### What's the strategy?
In a word, devices. By integrating with some common remote clinical instruments, like blood pressure cuffs, glucose monitors, scales for CHF and obesity patients, etc. In the near-future, [your medication bottles might be devices, too](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/adheretech/). Apple would be in a position route all of that information and control access to it.

Whereas in the past Grandpa might have had to go back to his primary care physician to get blood pressure readings, or make a visit to the emergency room if his meds were off, now we can prevent some of those outrageously expensive acute care incidents by intervening at the home. Mail-order pharmacies are almost 30% cheaper, and [less than a fifth of patients use them](http://www.drugchannels.net/2013/05/how-pharmacy-industry-ch-ch-changed-in.html). Many of the most common chronic medical conditions can be monitored much more effectively from home. Part of this is being driven by the shift to value-based care, and part by the fact that people just like home care better.

Whoever solves the problem of enabling the flow of private, secure clinically-relevant data between consumers/devices and providers/analytics partners/etc., and can capture a portion of the savings generated, is going to unlock a trillion-dollar opportunity.

### The ghosts of PHRs past
That this value exists is not news to anyone. Controlling large swaths of patient data by focusing on consumer adoption is a smart, bold idea, but it's ridiculously difficult to pull off. Microsoft knows this. They tried to do HealthVault and got nowhere. Google Health collapsed.

Part of the problem was always manual entry of the records. Now Apple has a tremendous opportunity to bootstrap real-time patient data directly upstream to providers. They can start redirecting the flow of all healthcare information into systems that are at least internally connected through a private API. Everyone knows Personal Health Records could be a goldmine, but no one has been able to execute on it. Now, because of their iPhone market presence, Apple has an incredible distribution platform cooked into the phone.

### It gets even better...for Apple
Apple isn't going to just offer a data layer for health, though. They're deep into the hardware game already. [They built the iPhone 5S with a new processor for tracking physical and motion data](http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/google-and-apple-race-healthcare). They also [took out a patent for a cardiac monitor](http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/24/apple-patents-integrated-heart-rate-monitor-for-smartphones-hover-touch-sensors/) that works in the background while someone is holding their phone. This is why Apple is interested in mobile medical applications, and [why they met with the FDA](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/apple-meets-with-f-d-a-regulators-for-mobile-medical-applications/): They're building their own. An iWatch could also be regulated as a medical device, in this context.

Some people are excited about wearables and think Apple is going to open up and ["legitimize" the market](http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/24/why-health-care-needs-apple/). I don't think so. Apple didn't "legitimize" MP3 players, they turned them into a near-monopoly ([72%+ market share](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod#Sales)). Apple didn't just "legitimize" smart phones, they totally dominated for years. Apple doesn't play to "legitimize" anymore, although they once did. Now they play to crush.

Interconnected health data could be the mama of new markets if there ever was one. That's what [Fred Wilson is excited about](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2014/02/ios8-health-data-and-open-data.html). But it's going to be a winner-take-all market for Apple unless anyone else can offer the same levels of ease of use, security, and privacy.

### What does this have to do with Aptible?
This is why secure, specified, compliant computing infrastructure for healthcare is important: it enables trust, which enables the flow of information.

What did we just find out about Target? It was [bad internal security controls and network configurationn](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/) that made the breach possible. Good business data security doesn't need to be NSA-proof, but it does have to be well-specified and maintained.

It's also why data security regulations and standardization are important: The payment industry has had well-specified, objective security standards for years, but [they are self-regulated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard). It's a tautology, but self-regulation results in exactly the kind of regulation you would come up with for your own benefit -- the one that is most advantageous for your corporate existence.

Self-regulation of sensitive data is good for business.

There are some very smart people getting involved with helping companies manage security in structured, standardized ways. For example, Bruce Schneier, one of the absolute top security guys, just joined [a company that manages regulatory and third-party requirements for security incident response](https://www.co3sys.com). That bears repeating: <em>they don't sell better security controls, they sell better incident responses</em>.

At Aptible, we build systems that deploy applications into auditable, well-specified, resilient runtime environments. Our role as a central, trusted team serves our customers by letting them just focus on their application layers, rather than having to manage their business logic <em>and</em> everything below it in the stack. Anyone who wants to move fast in healthcare should give us a call.

In the meantime, Apple has an enormous opportunity in front of it.
