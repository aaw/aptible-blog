On the road leading up to our public launch, we've talked to a lot of healthcare startups. Almost everyone says, "HIPAA is so complicated. What do I really need to know?"

HIPAA applies to all sorts of healthcare businesses, large and small. Here are eight important thoughts for startups:

### 1. The Rules Have Changed
The 2009 HITECH Act added a slew of mandatory requirements for regulated health tech companies. The compliance date for those [new rules](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/hipaa-simplification-201303.pdf) was September 23, 2013. So when you're looking for advice, be sure it's current. The new rules are harder to comply with.

### 2. Not Everyone Is Regulated...
...but there's a good chance you are.

HIPAA only applies to "covered entities" and "business associates." (See [pages 11 and 12 in the new rules](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/hipaa-simplification-201303.pdf).)

**"Covered entities"** are health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers who transmit "any health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction covered by" HIPAA. Those transactions [relate mostly to claims](http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/HIPAA-Administrative-Simplification/TransactionCodeSetsStands/index.html). A cash-only provider who never takes insurance might qualify as exempt, but as soon as he or she transmits a single regulated claim, he or she is 100% regulated. So, practically speaking, most providers are regulated.

**"Business associates"** create, receive, transmit, or maintain "protected health information" on behalf of a covered entity. That's a broad definition on purpose. Most health tech startups that are regulated are business associates. If you work with providers, payers, or clearinghouses, you're probably a business associate. You are a business associate even if you haven't signed a business associate agreement.

**"Protected Health Information,"** or "PHI," is individually identifiable health information that is transmitted or maintained in a medium or form. "Individually identifiable health information" is information created or received by a covered entity or employer that related to past, present, or future health, provision of health care, or payment for health care, where the individual in question can be identified. If the information you work with is tied to a covered entity and is interesting, it's probably PHI.

Finally, even if you're outside the scope of HIPAA, don't forget FTC regulations and state laws.

### 3. When Do We Need To Comply?
Before you handle live PHI. If you're pre-product and pre-customer, keep this in the back of your mind, but focus on finding a customer and solving their problems.

### 4. Why Should We Comply?
Upside and downside. On the upside, your customers will demand it. Sophisticated covered entities care about the trusworthiness of their business partners. Well documented compliance efforts go a **long** way towards building that trust. Good compliance efforts show that you've thought deeply and carefully about protecting their reputation.

On the downside, there is risk associated with not complying. If a breach occurs, your customers are going to hold you responsible. Compliance efforts help you negotiate reasonable indemnity provisions.

HHS also has civil and criminal enforcement authority. They reserve the harshest penalties for systematic non-complinance with multiple rules (such as not performing a risk analysis and not having policies, combined with a breach). It remains to be seen how the new rules will affect enforcment trends. Even before last year, HHS has [demonstrated interest in looking at patient privacy on the Internet](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/examples/pcsurgery_agreement.html). They have also stated that the [Audit Program](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/audit/) will be expanded to business associates (as required by HITECH) during the next audit cycle, later this year or early next year.

### 5. What Do We Have To Do?
You have to comply with three rules:

1. **The Privacy Rule** governs how third parties (like you) can use and disclose PHI. For the most part business associates piggyback on their covered entities' uses and disclosures.  You need to do things like document your disclosures of PHI, implement policies with required/permitted/prohibited uses and disclosures, document your relationships with subcontractors, and amend PHI when required.
2. **The Breach Notification Rule** governs what happens when you have an unauthorized use or disclosure of "unsecured" PHI. It is not a fun rule. Do everything you can not to trigger this rule. For an early-stage startup, if you trigger this rule you are probably going out of business. In this context "unsecured" essentially means "unencrypted," but securing PHI is so important that it gets its own rule...
3. **The Security Rule** governs how PHI is safeguarded. It is broken down into required and "addressable" portions. When a portion is addressable it means you either have to implement it or document why it would not be reasonable and take alternative measures. The [Security Standards Matrix](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/hipaa-simplification-201303.pdf) on pages 69-70 of the new rules covers some of the details.

### 6. How Do We Do That?
In a nutshell, perform a risk analysis (hopefully using an industry-standard methodology, like [NIST SP 800-30](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30-rev1/sp800_30_r1.pdf)), implement and document policies and procedures, and implement and document a training program for your workforce. Lather, rinse, repeat periodically.

### 7. Is This Easy?

Honestly, no. And it's not supposed to be. That's why they changed the law â€“ to have more stringent requirements for parties that deal with sensitive medical information.

### 8. Will It Hurt?

It depends. HIPAA is designed to apply to all kinds of entities, of all sizes. There is actually a lot of flexibility built into the rules.

The dirty secret of HIPAA is that it mostly involves showing your work. You retain a fair amount of operational flexibility if you properly document your business policies and processes. The paperwork is designed to force you to think about the privacy and security of information entrusted to you. If you have good business practices, and can document them well, you're 95% of the way there!
