When I say the terms "IT Operations" and "Software Development" together, what decade do you think of? Probably the 90s or at least early 2000s. For a long time, those terms reflected the gap (often a physical gap) between the places where software was made and the places where software was implemented or consumed. Now, both of those activities over the Internet. Software is developed on the Internet, using the Internet. Software is consumed and operated on the Internet, over the Internet. The locus of development and operations have shifted to a common location. But we still use the term "developer" all the time. We still have dev teams and ops teams. "DevOps" is a portmanteau because we don't even have a proper name for the real thing that does both at once.

At Aptible, we think some of the best software being developed is being implemented over the Internet. This has shrunk the software deployment cycle, the time from development to deployment and operation, to days, hours, and in some cases even minutes. Think about that: a live service that thousands of people are using and relying on simultaneously can be updated (with a fix we came up with 30 seconds ago and tested 10 seconds ago) while it is running - and appears to continue to run like nothing happened. That kind of resiliency is incredibly powerful.

In an environment like this, developers have to be operators, because no operator can keep up with system changes in that short amount of time. The inverse is also true: the operators need to be developers to understand what is happening to the system.

Paul Graham says startups are all about speed. Fast deployment cycles are rocket fuel, and they're cheaper than the rocket fuel VCs provide.




## On Aptible
Aptible is two powerful things, combined: a deployment platform and a set of integrated compliance tools. We use the platform to empower low transaction costs and lower fixed costs for rapid, iterative deployment of code. We use the compliance tools to empower the ability to operate in a regulated environment.

They're both domains where, to get the level of functionality and assurance we provide, you would previously have to hire several employees, or deal with contractors.

How much work does Aptible need to do to make financial sense? For many small and midsize companies, the math is compelling.

A single employee salaried at $100k/year costs ~$8,333/month, probably closer to $10-15k/month once benefits, office space, and other associated costs are included. $15k/month for a year is ~$20/hour, calculated 24/7. We cost less than $4/hour for a full Production Account.

If you think Aptible can, on average, do the work of one single employee of yours, you are immediately getting 5x your value back in time saved per dollar you spend on us.

More likely is that we'll save you the work of several employees, including many wasted hours avoided of service coordination and standardization, building and/or tweaking your config management systems, and evaluating infrastructure changes, etc.

Is that close to what a single employee might do in a month? More?

Spend the money, save the time, and really focus on what you do best.
