The Big Three
-------------
Last week we laid out a basic sketch of the HIPAA regulatory landscape for health tech startups. The gist of it was that if you are regulated, you need to comply with three rules: The Privacy Rule, the Security Rule, and the Breach Notification Rule.

What do those those rules require you to do?

> In a nutshell, perform a risk analysis (hopefully using an industry-standard methodology, like [NIST SP 800-30](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30-rev1/sp800_30_r1.pdf)), implement and document policies and procedures, and implement and document a training program for your workforce. Lather, rinse, repeat periodically.

Today, I'll explain how the Office for Civil Rights, HIPAA's regulatory enforcement entity, would check your compliance status and how the regulations broadly affect your normal business operations.

### Audit All The Things
In 2011 and 2012, HHS started an audit program for covered entities. As part of the audit process, they publicly released an [Audit Protocol](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/audit/).

(We publish an [version of the protocol that you can easily search and scroll](https://www.aptible.com/protocols).)

The CE protocol consists of 169 "key activities," each of which contains several "audit procedures," or verification steps. Most of the procedures break down into three categories:

1. Inquiries, or questions,
2. Directives to obtain documents or evidence, and
3. Determinations with regards to standards.

Why is the audit protocol for covered entities relevant for tech startups? The 2009 HITECH Act requires HHS to audit covered entities <em>and</em> business associates (i.e., most health tech companies). They just haven't gotten around to the business associates ... yet. HHS says they will start the BA audit program later this year or early in 2015. Aptible uses a proprietary, 363-step protocol to audit our customers now, and will incorporate the official BA protocol when it is published.

### The Big Three

HIPAA is detail-oriented. 169 key activities (or 363 separate audit procedures) are a lot of little steps to think about and document. The good news is that they mostly break down into three interrelated areas that can be addressed through the Security Rule. I call them **HIPAA's Big Three**:

1. The **Risk Assessment** requirement, found in 45 CFR ยง 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A),
2. The "**Policies and Procedures** and Documentation Requirements," found in ยง 164.316, which require you to document the work done to comply with the rest of the Security Rule, and
3. The **Training Standard** in ยง 164.308(a)(5).

Together with your normal business operations, the Big Three make up the HIPAA compliance cycle HHS expects you to perform "periodically" and "as needed in response to environmental or operational changes."

A rock-solid compliance cycle uses the Risk Assessment to make sane and justifiable choices about organizational policies. HIPAA doesn't require Ft. Knox-level security controls, but you do have to be able to explain and defend your actions. A thorough, professional Risk Assessment is the backstop.

Policies and procedures in turn drive training, which affects operations, which determine business results. When it comes time to repeat the cycle, you use what you learned in operation to improve your Big Three. Learn more, make better decisions, train better, get better results. That's the basic idea.
